# Shoe-Collection-C-v1
First version of shoe collection program written in C++

A personal project I decided to undertakeand I got it working but have imporovements in store such as:
  1) Being able to import and edit a current collection (like the current python version)
  2) Being able to use a class as opposed to three different arrays
  3) More error catching precautions
  4) Probably more I can't remember right now

# Shoe-Collection-C-v1
First version of shoe collection program written in C++

A personal project I decided to undertake since I have a lot of shoes and know a lot of people that also have a lot of shoes. It would 
basically let you keep track of all your shoes and let you sort it alphabetically. Also theoretically you should be able to save your collection and come back to it to edit it by adding shoes as you buy more or removing shoes as you get rid of some in your collection.

I got it working but have imporovements in store such as:
  1) Being able to import and edit a current collection (like the current python version)
  2) Being able to use a class as opposed to three different arrays
  3) More error catching precautions
  4) Using vectors instead of trying to use dynamic arrays
